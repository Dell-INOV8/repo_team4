# DELL CONNECT v0.0.1

Dell Connect is a machine learning powered internal social and professional platform to connect team members of Dell HQ by specific interests. The user begins by creating personal profiles specifying employee information. (ie. name, email, building location, team, etc.) Users customize their profile by ranking various interests from 0-10. Dell Connect suggests matches to users based on similar interests suggesting one on one meet ups, backed by k means clustering. At any time users are able to reflect their network on their profile by friending users.

### Modes

Dell Connect features two modes to connect users: career mode + after hours mode. In career mode, users rank interests pertaining to career aspirations and interests. These interests include management, technology, business, etc. In after hours mode, users rank interests reflecting hobbies after work. These interests include hiking, gaming, cooking, etc.

### Prototype

The "Your Profile" and "Your Interests" tabs are built out but the "Discover" and "Connect" tabs are not yet. Currently, this protoype is for Dell only but will be expanded to other companies. A wider range of professional and social interests will be added, as well as the ability for more profile customization. A friending component will be added through the "Connect" tab so employees can build their networks and stay in touch with people they meet through the matching process. With the "Discover" feature, users can search for other employees to friend by name, interests, position, etc.
