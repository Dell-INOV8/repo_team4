# DELL CONNECT v0.0.1

Dell Connect is an internal social and professional platform to connect team members of Dell HQ. The user begins by creating personal profiles specifying employee information. (ie. name, email, building location, team, etc.) Users customize their profile by ranking various interests from 0-10. (ie. hiking, gaming, cooking, etc.) Powered by Dell Connect machine learning, Dell Connect matches users based on similar interests suggesting one on one meet ups. At any time users are able to reflect their network on their profile by friending users.
